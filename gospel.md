### All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
* "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."  Romans 3:10-12

* "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." 1 John 1:8

* “But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.” Isaiah 64:6

* “The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.” Psalms 94:11

* "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?" Jeremiah 17:9

### God, our creator, is good, just and perfect, and accordingly he can not have fellowship with sinners or workers of iniquity.

* “Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?” Habakkuk 1:13

* “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.” Matthew 5:48

* “And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.” Revelation 21:27

### The sinful iniquity of man has separated him from God, and we all deserve the penalty for sin, which is death.

* “But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.” Isaiah 59:2

* “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Romans 6:23

* “And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.” Revelation 20:10

### Because God loved us, he does not want us to perish. He wants us to have everlasting life. He sent his son Jesus as a sacrifice, who paid the penalty for our sin, and defeated sin and death on the cross after he died, was buried, and resurrected.

* “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” John 3:16

* “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” Romans 5:8

* “And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.” 1 Timothy 3:16

* "Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures." 1 Corinthians 15:1-4

### Jesus lived the perfect, sinless life that we never could.

* "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." 2 Corinthians 5:21

* "Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth..." 1 Peter 2:22 

* "And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin." 1 John 3:5

### Jesus is God in the flesh. He is also the son of God. He is 100% God and 100% man. There are three in heaven that testify, and these three are one. 

* "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth." John 1:14

* "For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.” 1 John 5:7

* “I and my Father are one.” John 10:30

### If you believe on Jesus, your sins will be washed away. You will receive the Holy Spirit, and be blameless and justified before God. When you die you will have everlasting life.

* “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” Romans 10:9

* "And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house." Acts 16:30

Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God." 1 Corinthians 6:9-11

### There is no salvation by any other name, including your own... 

* “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” Acts 4:12

* “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.” Titus 3:5

### ...and so if you think that you are saved because you have done good works, or because you're a good person, or because you love God, or because you've avoided sin - YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY TO HELL. 

* “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.” Ephesians 2:8

* “Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.” Galatians 2:16

* “So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.” Romans 9:16

* "I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture." John 10:9-11

* “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.” John 10:1-3

* "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened." Matthew 7:7

### All you must do to be saved is to accept the free gift that God has given you, that Christ has paid the ultimate price for. The blood of Christ is sufficient to blot out any sin, no matter how great.

* “But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.” Romans 5:15

* "And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world." 1 John 2:2

* "And from Jesus Christ, [who is] the faithful witness, [and] the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood..." Revelation 1:5

### You can never lose your salvation, and if you believe you can, you aren't saved because you aren't trusting on Jesus, but on your own righteousness to save you. 

* "Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption [for us]." Hebrews 9:12 

* “Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:” Philippians 1:6

* “And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. I and my Father are one.” John 10:28-30

* “All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.” John 6:37

* “In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.” Ephesians 1:13-14

* “And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.” Ephesians 4:30

* “For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.” Romans 11:29

* "Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts." 2 Corinthians 1:22

### You don't have to repent of (turn from or confess) any sins to be saved. If you believe otherwise, you are trusting on your works. Confessing THE FACT that you are a sinner, and confessing the name of Jesus is enough.
* "And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not." Jonah 3:10

* “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” Romans 10:9 

### This Gospel is everlasting, and applies to every time period: in the past, now, and forevermore. If you rely on Jesus alone for salvation you can KNOW that you are saved. 

* “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people...” Revelation 14:6

* "For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness." Romans 4:3

* “Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.” Genesis 13:4

* “These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.” Hebrews 11:13

* “Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.  Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.  And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.” Galatians 3:6-8

* "These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God." 1 John 5:13-15
