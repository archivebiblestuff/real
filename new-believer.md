## 1. Get a Bible/read it

Get yourself a KJV Bible (not referenced) and start reading in the [book of John.](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-Chapter-1/)

Make the commitment to read the whole [book of John](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-Chapter-1/) before you quit.

You will get used to the language after reading it for a week. You can go to the table of
contents and check it off to keep track.

## 3. Get baptized
Now you believe you can be baptised as a symbol and commandment.
Acts 8:36-37 - _And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water:
and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he
answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

## 4. Learn how to Preach the Gospel

Proverbs 11:30 - _The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise._

Mark 16:15 - _And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to
every creature_
