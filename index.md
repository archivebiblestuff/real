# The Bible Way to Heaven

## 1. Sin

```Romans 3:23: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.```

If you're reading this, you're a sinner. If you're not, you're still a sinner. You are a sinner, I am a sinner. We've all sinned. You need to understand that first and foremost

```Romans 6:23: For the wages of sin is death.```

## 2. Hell

Because of your sin, you are dying. You will die someday, and it is inevitable. Understand this

```Revelation 20:14: And death and hell were cast into the Lake of fire. This is the second death.```

You die once on Earth, this is the wages of your sins. But some people are going to be going to second death, which is known as the lake of fire, or Hell. But it's not just death and hell going, there are more

```Revelation 21:8: But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.```

Notice what it says, "all liars" are going. I've lied before, you've probably lied before. This is such a common sin, you need to be fearful of this. You will join death and hell in the second death. That is Hell, it is eternal death.

```Romans 6:23: For the wages of sin is death;  but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.```

Earlier, I cut Romans 6:23. As we can see here, the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. What that means is that while we have the "wages" of the first death, we do not need to go to the second death. We have a gift from God, and that is eternal life. But will even sinners get this?

## 3. Christ Died for Us
```Romans 5:8: But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.```

Jesus Christ died for you. He didn't do that thinking you were worthy by your mighty works, he did it because he loved you even though you were a sinner. So we are all sinners, and we all deserve death, and we all deserve Hell, and yet we have a gift of eternal life from Christs death. Is his death the end though?

```1 Corinthians 15:3-4: For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:```

Christ died for our sins, he was buried in the Earth, and he rose again on the third day. And as it said in the verse above, He did this for us. He gave us the gift of not eternal death in Hell, but eternal life in Heaven. 

## 4. Believe to be Saved

How do we get this gift of eternal life though?

```Romans 10:9: That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.```

Read this verse again, with power this time. We can escape the second death which we all deserve by believing on Christ. This is good news. This is gospel.

Confess the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved. Look at the most famous verse in the Bible

```John 3:16: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.```

Anyone, who believes. Whosoever believes, will not perish but have everlasting life. It continues on

```John 3:17-18: For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.```

God sent Jesus to save us and not condemn us, but you will be condemned if you don't believe. 

```Romans 5:1: Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:```

After we get justified by faith, there is of course one more thing. Peace. We will have peace with God, Christians will still be persecuted here, but they will have peace with God, not with men. We do not need to worry about what will happen to us after death, because we are saved.

## 6. Faith alone, no works

```Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.```

Works can't save us, it is only faith

```Isaiah 64:6 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.```

All our works (when it comes to salvation) are as filthy rags. It's good to do them, but the mindset of working your way to heaven is cringe to God

```Galatians 2:16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.```

Following the law does not save you

```Galatians 2:21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.```

If your works come by the law, why did Christ have to die?

## 7. Eternal security
What happens if we sin though?

```Romans 8:38-39: For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.```

When we are saved, we are saved. Once saved, always saved. Nothing at all can separate you from your salvation.

``` Hebrews 12:6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.```

```Hebrews 12:9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live```

He will chastise us just like our fathers of our flesh

```John 10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.```

No man (or your works) can take salvation from Jesus' hand

```John 6:37 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.```

He will not cast out your salvation from his hand


## Keep in Mind:
* We all sin.
* We all deserve hell.
* Jesus died, was buried, and rose again for our sake.
* Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved.
* Your salvation is eternal.

I'll end this with a prayer. If you say it truly believing every word, you will be saved.

```Dear Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I deserve to go to hell, but I believe that you died for me, was buried, and rose again. Please save me and give me eternal life. I’m only trusting in you, not my works. In Jesus’ name I pray. Amen.```

Hey, you meant that, didn’t you. You know the Bible says you’re on your way to Heaven. There’s nothing you can do to lose it. Isn’t that great news? :)
