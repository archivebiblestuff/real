## What is Sin?
#### 1 John 3:4
> Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
###### Sin is the offense of God's law.
## Who Sinned?
#### Romans 3:10
> As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
#### Romans 3:23
> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
#### Ecclesiastes 7:20
> For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
###### ALL have sinned, not one of us is perfect.
#### James 2:10
>  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
###### Even if you just broke one part of God's law, you're guilty before God. Because God is holy, just and perfect, and nothing that is dirty will enter life...
#### Revelation 21:24
> And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.
