title: Why KJV?
description: The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.

**1.** As affirmed by the events of Pentecost, God wants every person to interact with his word in their native language. The King James Bible is the inerrant word of God in the modern English language. Therefore, there is no need for any other translation. Reach out to an Admin for approved translations in other languages. 

**2.** Modern translations tamper with scripture, and are filled with contradictions, translation errors, false doctrine, and blasphemy. They make a mockery of the word of God and remove numerous key verses. 

**3.** God promised in Psalm 12:6-8 and Matthew 24:35 that he would preserve his word for every generation forever. Modern translations are predicated on the claim that the Bible should be supplemented on a continuous basis by new archaeological findings. Therefore, they are denying God's promise to preserve his word by editorializing it every year. Of course, they only do this to line their own pockets by releasing new additions for profit. For the love of money is the root of all evil.

**4.** The King James Bible is easier to read. Modern translations use confusing and archaic language. Here's a sample of words found in the NIV: alcove, algum, bier, carnelian, chrysolite, colonnades, coney, cors, dandled, dappled, denarii, dragnet, dropsy, ewe, goiim, henna, ignoble, mattocks, offal, omer, wadi.

**5.** The King James Bible is a product of superior scholarship. Forty-seven translators and scholars produced the King James Bible, many of which were polyglots who fluently spoke languages that are dead today. 

**6.** The King James Bible has been the Bible of record of Western Civilization for over 400 years. No other translation comes close to this level of influence.

* The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O Lord, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. <8> The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.

* Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
